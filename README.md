* Coding language / frameworks
Typescript, React, CSS

* Improvements made on top of readonly:
Allow zooming in and out of the timeline, allow editing the name of events inline

* How long you spent on the assignment.
About 7 hours of focus time

* What you like about your implementation.
Since I like building from scratch, being able to implement it with css / react styles and not rely on libraries.

* What you would change if you were going to do it again.
See what CSS grid could help me do, implement drag & dropping

* How you made your design decisions. For example, if you looked at other timelines for inspiration, please note that.
The project I worked on previously at my old company was a date table kind of like this one, however each row's data was provided, so there was no sorting or arrangements of items between rows to be done like this one did

* How you would test this if you had more time.
Snapshot tests for the components and write tests for every function in utils.tsx
